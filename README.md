# ResponsivePortfolio
Week 2 Homework 

Description:
This is a redesign of a previous website utilizing Bootstrap CDN and responsive design. Custom CSS was added to the site to maintain the design of the first site. Favicon added from previous site as well. There are three pages on this site and a contact form that emails no one as of now. 

I added a media query only for the 640px screen on the nav bar, so that it would flush the full width. 

The portfolio images are not images in my site, but rather h3 tags with attached background images. As such, they aren't responsive like images and don't change widths depending on the screen size. Hopefully you can see that I do understand the concept of repsonsive images, since I utilize it for my About Me page. 

Installation:
I do not think this site requires any installation instructions.

Usage:
This is a portfolio and is only intended to contact and see the work of the developer.
